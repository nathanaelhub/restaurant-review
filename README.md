# Restaurant Review Sentiment and Predictive Analysis
## Project Outline:
### Objective:
This Data Dive project aimed to analyze restaurant reviews across five states (AB, QC, OH, AZ, ON) to identify key factors contributing to customer satisfaction, particularly focusing on 1-star and 5-star reviews. Using sentiment analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project uncovered patterns in customer feedback related to food quality, service, and specific menu items.

### Data Overview:

The dataset consists of restaurant reviews and corresponding business data from multiple states, merged into a unified dataset for analysis.
Key attributes include restaurant location, review text, and star ratings.
The project focused on two main categories of restaurants: Chinese and Mexican.

### Methodology:

Data Cleaning & Merging: Combined restaurant review datasets and filtered relevant columns, dropping unnecessary or incomplete data.
Sentiment Analysis: Applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and n-gram generation to identify common themes in 1-star and 5-star reviews.
N-Gram Analysis: Generated bigrams, trigrams, and quadgrams to uncover recurring patterns related to specific dishes (e.g., "orange chicken") and service experiences.
Word Cloud & Frequency Distribution: Visualized frequently mentioned words and phrases to highlight customer sentiment trends.
Comparison of Ratings: Compared reviews to identify the drivers of positive and negative experiences in different cuisines.

### Outcome:

1-Star Reviews: Revealed common complaints regarding specific dishes and poor service, such as delays in receiving orders.
5-Star Reviews: Showed that quality food presentation and efficient service were major contributors to high customer satisfaction.
Actionable Insights: Identified that food quality, especially in frequently ordered dishes like "chicken fried rice," played a significant role in driving both positive and negative reviews.

### Conclusion:
The analysis provided clear insights into the most frequent factors influencing restaurant reviews. By identifying trends in customer feedback, the project offers actionable recommendations for restaurants to improve their service and menu items, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.
